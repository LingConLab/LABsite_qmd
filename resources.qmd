## Spoken corpora {#spoken-corpora}

At the Linguistic Convergence Laboratory we create spoken corpora, which give users access to audio recordings of texts as well as transcription. Audio access allows researchers to study languages at different levels, without having to rely on annotator's transcription alone. It is important to keep in mind that searching these corpora is based on a standardized glossing of texts, so that any study of linguistic features cannot rely on transcription alone but also requires listening to all the examples used.

The Laboratory develops corpora of dialectal, regional, and bilingual speech variations, predominantly those spoken in rural areas.

An important aspect of the Laboratory's spoken corpora is the availability of sociolinguistic metadata about the speakers including information about their age, sex, education, place of residency, and command of other languages.

The spoken corpora are developed in cooperation with researchers from other universities and institutions. The Laboratory is open to the development of new resources.

## Dictionaries {#dictionaries}

Dictionaries contain audio and text data from several villages of Daghestan. The wordlists are based on for dictionaries derives primarily from the Jena proposal for a unified comparative lexicon of the languages of Daghestan and include bothintends to cover the Swadesh list and Kibrik and Kodzasovâ€™s thesaurus for Daghestanian languages together with some additional items.

## Other resources {#other}

In addition to dictionaries and corpora, the Laboratory also develops databases and atlases containing lexical, grammatical and sociolinguistic data from many villages of Daghestan.
