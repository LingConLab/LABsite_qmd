    "text": "At the Linguistic Convergence Laboratory we create spoken corpora, which give users access to audio recordings of texts as well as their transcription. Audio access allows researchers to study languages at different levels, without having to rely on the annotator’s transcription alone. It is important to keep in mind that the search function in these corpora is based on a standardized glossing of texts, so any study of linguistic features cannot rely on transcription alone but also requires listening to all the examples used.\nThe Laboratory develops corpora of dialectal, regional, and bilingual speech varieties, predominantly those spoken in rural areas.\nAn important aspect of the Laboratory’s spoken corpora is the availability of sociolinguistic metadata about the speakers including information about their age, gender, education, place of residence, and command of other languages.\nThe spoken corpora are developed in cooperation with researchers from other universities and institutions.
